## Ted's section

This repository contains the pong server that is automatically built and pushed to GitHub Container Registry using GitHub Actions.

## Docker Image

The Docker image is available at: https://github.com/tedph-cyber/pong-server/pkgs/container/pong-server

Knock yourself as I too was most definitely knocked out 🙂‍↕️

T'was tedious in order of lower stress: 
  - Building the docker image
  - Pushing to Github, due to my diverted branches, it stressed me more than building the image
  - Battling with the Github action, there was the inline version stuffs that were confusing me per the official docs. Tsk smh
  - Ofc this seemingly easy README is the most tedious mostly because of my mindset... lol
But I survived it all Alhamdulilah

OFficially done, I think...

Oh, btw my own image is not showing I dont know why. Tsk 🙂‍↔️
